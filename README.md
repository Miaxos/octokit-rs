Automatic Octokit Types for Rust build by using [typify](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/typify).

Every hour, we fetch the JSON Schema and build the lib, if the API changed we
release a new version.

## Webhooks

We use [octokit/webhooks](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks/) to generate this
library, feel free to go check them out.
